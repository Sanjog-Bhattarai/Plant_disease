Plant Disease Detection
Overview
Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to identify diseases in plants through images. This tool is built to help farmers and gardeners quickly diagnose plant diseases and take appropriate actions to protect their crops.

Features
Disease Detection: Upload an image of a plant, and the model will predict the disease affecting the plant.
Image Preprocessing: The system preprocesses images to improve accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation and usage.
How It Works
Image Upload: Users upload an image of the affected plant.
Prediction: The model processes the image and predicts the disease.
Result: The result is displayed with details about the disease and suggestions for treatment.
Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,React
Database: mongodb
Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
